#Frontier RIDAC

Frontier RIDAC is an Open Source RFID Audit Framework released to the community by OUSPG in 2009. 
This framework attempts to systematically document RFID related threats and how to systematically audit unknown RFID systems against these risks. This site codifies the audit process, documents hardware to support the audits and provides a software toolkit to assist the analysis.
